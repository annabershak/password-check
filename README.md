# Digital Product School -- Technical Task
#### The task is to create a password validator with the following details: 

Create a web page for validation of passwords entered by users. The rules for a valid password are the following:
	•	it should have the length of 8-16 symbols
	•	it should contain letters of Latin alphabet and at least one digit
	•	it should not contain full English words (you can use any free dictionary API to check this)
Examples: valid passwords: hel1lo, catap2ult, invalid passwords: hello1, hell1o, cat2apult.

For this task, I have chosen the React framework. 

## How to start

At first, you need to install dependencies.  

### `npm install axios`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
